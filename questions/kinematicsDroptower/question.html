    The gondola of a drop tower ride is lifted up from the ground with an acceleration of ${{params.a}}$ m/s$^2$, starting from rest. The lifting forces are removed after ${{params.t}}$ seconds, and the gondola starts experiencing a free fall (only gravitational forces are present). The brakes are applied once the gondola is at half a distance from the bottom. Assume acceleration of gravity equal to $9.8$ m/s$^2$.
