  <p>
    An object is thrown with a fixed initial speed $v_0$ at various angles $\alpha$ with respect to the horizon. 
    The speed of the object at a height $h$ above the horizon is denoted as $v$. Assuming there is no air resistance, select the correct statement regarding the dependence of the speed $v$ and the initial angle $\alpha$.

<pl-multiple-choice answers-name="ans" weight="1">
  <pl-answer correct="false">The speed $v$ increases monotonically with the angle $\alpha$.</pl-answer>
  <pl-answer correct="true">The speed $v$ remains constant and is not dependent on the angle $\alpha$.</pl-answer>
  <pl-answer correct="false">The speed $v$ increases until it reaches a maximum value, and the time it takes to reach this value depends on the angle $\alpha$ and the initial velocity $v_0$.</pl-answer>
  <pl-answer correct="false">The speed $v$ decreases until it reaches a minimum value, and the time it takes to reach this value depends on the angle $\alpha$ and the initial velocity $v_0$.</pl-answer>
